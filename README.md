# React Orders & Restaurants Project

This is a React-based project that demonstrates fetching and displaying data from **orders** and **restaurants** JSON files using PHP and Axios for HTTP requests.

---

## Project Overview

- The project uses **React** for the frontend and **PHP** to fetch data from JSON files.
- **Axios** is used for making HTTP requests from React to the PHP API endpoints.
- The project includes **copy versions** of the `data` and `api` folders inside the project directory for reference and testing purposes.
- The **real data** and **API endpoints** are hosted on my server at [yasir.world](https://yasir.world), and the React app in production would ideally fetch data from these endpoints.
